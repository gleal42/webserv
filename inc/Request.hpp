Connection							Control options for the current connection and								Connection: keep-alive
									list of hop-by-hop request fields.											Connection: Upgrade
Content-Encoding					The type of encoding used on the data. 										Content-Encoding: gzip
Content-Length						The length of the request body in octets (8-bit bytes).						Content-Length: 348
Content-MD5							A Base64-encoded binary MD5 sum of the content of the request body.			Content-MD5: Q2hlY2sgSW50ZWdyaXR5IQ==
Content-Type						The Media type of the body of the request									Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

Date								The date and time at which the message was originated (HTTP-date			Date: Tue, 15 Nov 1994 08:12:31 GMT
									format).
Expect								Indicates that particular server behaviors are required by the client.		Expect: 100-continue
Forwarded							Disclose original information of a client connecting to a web server 		Forwarded: for=192.0.2.60;proto=http;by=203.0.113.43

									number on which the server is listening. The port number may be omitted if	Host: en.wikipedia.org
									the port is the standard port for the service requested (Mandatory).
If-Match							Only perform the action if the client supplied entity matches the same 		If-Match: "737060cd8c284d8af7ad3082f209582d"
									entity on the server. This is mainly for methods like PUT to only update a
									resource if it has not been modified since the user last updated it.

									currently requested page was followed.
TE									The transfer encodings the user agent is willing to accept:					TE: trailers, deflate
									the same values as for the response header field
									Transfer-Encoding can be used, plus the ""trailers"" value
									(related to the ""chunked"" transfer method) to notify the
									server it expects to receive additional fields in the trailer after the
